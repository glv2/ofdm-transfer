ofdm-transfer
=============

ofdm-transfer is a command-line program to send or receive data by software
defined radio using the OFDM modulation.


## Usage

ofdm-transfer [options] [filename]

Options:
  -b <bit rate>  (default: 38400 b/s)
    Bit rate of the OFDM transmission.
  -c <ppm>  (default: 0.0, can be negative)
    Correction for the radio clock.
  -d <filename>
    Dump a copy of the samples sent to or received from
    the radio.
  -e <fec[,fec]>  (default: h128,none)
    Inner and outer forward error correction codes to use.
  -f <frequency>  (default: 434000000 Hz)
    Frequency of the OFDM transmission.
  -g <gain>  (default: 0)
    Gain of the radio transceiver.
  -h
    This help.
  -i <id>  (default: "")
    Transfer id (at most 4 bytes). When receiving, the frames
    with a different id will be ignored.
  -m <modulation>  (default: qpsk)
    Modulation to use for the subcarriers.
  -n <subcarriers[,cyclic prefix[,taper]]>  (default: 64,16,4)
    Number of subcarriers, cyclic prefix length and taper length
    of the OFDM transmission.
  -o <offset>  (default: 0 Hz, can be negative)
    Set the central frequency of the transceiver 'offset' Hz
    lower than the signal frequency to send or receive.
  -r <radio type>  (default: "")
    Radio to use.
  -s <sample rate>  (default: 2000000 S/s)
    Sample rate to use.
  -t
    Use transmit mode.
  -v
    Print debug messages.

By default the program is in 'receive' mode.
Use the '-t' option to use the 'transmit' mode.

In 'receive' mode, the samples are received from the radio,
and the decoded data is written either to 'filename' if it
is specified, or to standard output.
In 'transmit' mode, the data to send is read either from
'filename' if it is specified, or from standard input,
and the samples are sent to the radio.

Instead of a real radio transceiver, the 'io' radio type uses
standard input in 'receive' mode, and standard output in
'transmit' mode. The samples must be in 'complex float' format
(32 bits for the real part, 32 bits for the imaginary part).


## Compilation

ofdm-transfer requires the following dependencies:
  - libliquid (https://github.com/jgaeddert/liquid-dsp)
  - libSoapySDR (https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR)

It can be compiled with the usual:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make


## Supported radios

ofdm-transfer uses the SoapySDR API, therefore if your radio is supported by
SoapySDR and you have the right driver installed, it should work.

When used with the '-h' option to print the help message, ofdm-transfer will
also list the radios that it has detected.


## Supported subcarrier modulations
  - bpsk
  - qpsk
  - psk8
  - apsk16
  - apsk32
  - apsk64
  - apsk128
  - apsk256


## Supported FEC codes

The forward error correction codes that can be specified with the '-e' option
are the codes that are supported by libliquid.

These should always be available:
  - none
  - rep3: repeat(3)
  - rep5: repeat(5)
  - h74: Hamming(7,4)
  - h84: Hamming(8,4)
  - h128: Hamming(12,8)
  - g2412: Golay(24,12)
  - secded2216: SEC-DEC(22,16)
  - secded3932: SEC-DEC(39,32)
  - secded7264: SEC-DEC(72,64)

If your libliquid library has been compiled with support for the libfec
library, the following codes should also be available:
  - v27: convolutional r1/2 K=7
  - v29: convolutional r1/2 K=9
  - v39: convolutional r1/3 K=9
  - v615: convolutional r1/6 K=15
  - v27p23: convolutional r2/3 K=7 (punctured)
  - v27p34: convolutional r3/4 K=7 (punctured)
  - v27p45: convolutional r4/5 K=7 (punctured)
  - v27p56: convolutional r5/6 K=7 (punctured)
  - v27p67: convolutional r6/7 K=7 (punctured)
  - v27p78: convolutional r7/8 K=7 (punctured)
  - v29p23: convolutional r2/3 K=9 (punctured)
  - v29p34: convolutional r3/4 K=9 (punctured)
  - v29p45: convolutional r4/5 K=9 (punctured)
  - v29p56: convolutional r5/6 K=9 (punctured)
  - v29p67: convolutional r6/7 K=9 (punctured)
  - v29p78: convolutional r7/8 K=9 (punctured)
  - rs8: Reed-Solomon, 223/255


## Library

You can add OFDM transfer support to your programs easily by using the
'libofdm-transfer' library.
The API is described in the 'ofdm-transfer.h' file.
